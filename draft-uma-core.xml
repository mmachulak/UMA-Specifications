      <t>This specification defines the User-Managed Access (UMA) core
      protocol. This protocol provides a method for users to control access to
      their protected resources, residing on any number of host sites, through
      an authorization manager that makes access decisions based on user
      policy.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The User-Managed Access (UMA) core protocol provides a method based
      on <xref target="OAuth2"></xref> (currently draft 16) for users to
      control access to their protected resources, residing on any number of
      host sites, through a single authorization manager (AM) that makes
      access decisions based on user policy.</t>

      <t>There are numerous use cases for UMA, where a resource owner
      nominates a third party to control access to these resources potentially
      without the real-time presence of the resource owner. A typical example
      is the following. A web user (authorizing user) can authorize a web app
      (requester) to gain one-time or ongoing access to a resource containing
      his home address stored at a "personal data store" service (host), by
      telling the host to act on access decisions made by his authorization
      decision-making service (authorization manager or AM). The requesting
      party might be an e-commerce company whose site is acting on behalf of
      the user himself to assist him/her in arranging for shipping a purchased
      item, or it might be his friend who is using an online address book
      service to collect addresses, or it might be a survey company that uses
      an online service to compile population demographics. Other scenarios
      and use cases for UMA usage can be found in (<xref
      target="UMA-usecases"></xref>) and <xref
      target="UMA-userstories"></xref>.</t>

      <t>In enterprise settings, application access management often involves
      letting back-office applications serve only as policy enforcement points
      (PEPs), depending entirely on access decisions coming from a central
      policy decision point (PDP) to govern the access they give to
      requesters. This separation eases auditing and allows policy
      administration to scale in several dimensions. UMA makes use of a
      separation similar to this, letting the authorizing user serve as a
      policy administrator crafting authorization strategies on his or her own
      behalf.</t>

      <t>The UMA protocol profiles and extends <xref target="OAuth2"></xref>.
      An AM serves as an enhanced OAuth authorization server; a host serves as
      an enhanced resource server; and a requester serves as an enhanced
      client, acquiring an access token and the requisite authorization to
      access a protected resource at the host.</t>

      <t>UMA also defines an interoperable protection API between the AM and
      host, allowing them to reside in separate domains and allowing the host
      to establish mutual trust with an AM on behalf of a particular user.
      This API is itself OAuth-protected. Thus, the overall UMA flow has a
      second embedded OAuth-based interaction within it governing the host-AM
      relationship.</t>

      <t>The UMA protocol has three broad phases (see <xref
      target="UMA-phases"></xref>).</t>

      <t>The phases work as follows: <list style="numbers">
          <t>Protect a resource: This phase involves the authorizing user,
          host, and AM. The authorizing user has chosen to use a host for
          managing online resources ("A"), and introduces this host to an AM
          using an OAuth-mediated interaction that results in the AM giving
          the host an access token. The host uses AM's protection interface to
          tell the AM what sets of resources to protect ("C"). Out of band of
          the UMA protocol, the authorizing user instructs the AM what
          policies to attach to the registered resource sets ("B"). This phase
          is described in <xref target="protecting-a-resource"></xref>.</t>

          <t>Get authorization: This phase involves the requester, host, and
          AM. It may also involve synchronous involvement by the authorizing
          user if this person is synonymous with the requesting party. This
          phase is dominated by a loop of activity in which the requester
          approaches the host seeking access to a protected resource ("E"), is
          sent to obtain an access token from the AM if it does not have one,
          and then must demonstrate to the AM that it satisfies the user's
          authorization policy governing the sought-for resource and scope of
          access if the host discovers that it does not have the requisite
          authorization ("D"). This phase is described in <xref
          target="getting-authz-accessing-resource"></xref>.</t>

          <t>Access a resource: This phase involves the requester successfully
          presenting an access token that has sufficient permission associated
          with it to the host in order to gain access to the desired resource
          ("E"). This phase is described along with Phase 2 in <xref
          target="getting-authz-accessing-resource"></xref>.</t>

    <section anchor="protecting-a-resource" title="Protecting a Resource">
      <t>Phase 1 of UMA is protecting a resource. For a host to be able to
      delegate authorization of protected-resource access to an AM, the
      authorizing user must first introduce the host to the AM. This phase is
      concluded successfuly when: <list style="symbols">
          <t>The host has received metadata about the AM, such as OAuth
          endpoints.</t>

          <t>The host has received an OAuth host access token that represents
          the authorizing user's approval for the host to work with the AM in
          protecting resources. This host access token is used when the host
          makes requests at the AM's protection interface.</t>

          <t>The AM has acquired information about resource sets on the host
          it is supposed to protect on behalf of the User.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The user, host, and AM perform the following steps in order to
      successfully complete Phase 1: <list style="numbers">
          <t>The host looks up the AM's metadata and learns about its
          protection API endpoints and supported formats.</t>

          <t>If the host has not yet obtained an OAuth client identifier and
          optional secret from the AM, it registers with the AM dynamically as
          required, for example via the UMA dynamic registration protocol (see
          <xref target="Dyn-Reg">Dyn-Reg</xref>).</t>

          <t>The host obtains a host access token from the AM with the
          authorizing user's consent, using either the authorization code
          grant type or of the SAML bearer assertion grant type.</t>

          <t>The host optionally registers scopes with the AM that are
          intended to be protected (see <xref target="reg-api"></xref>).</t>
        </list></t>

      <section title="Host Looks Up AM Metadata">
        <t>The host needs to learn the OAuth- and UMA-related endpoints of the
        AM before they can begin interacting. The authorizing user might
        provide the AM's location to get the host started in this process, for
        example by typing a URL into a web form field or clicking a button.
        Alternatively, the host might already be configured to work with a
        single AM without requiring any user input. The exact process is
        beyond the scope of this specification, and it is up to the host to
        choose a method to learn the AM's location.</t>

        <t>From the data provided, discovered, or configured, the host MUST
        retrieve the hostmeta document as described in Section 2 of <xref
        target="hostmeta">hostmeta</xref>. For example, if the user supplied
        "am.example.com" as the Authorization Manager's domain, the host
        creates the URL "https://am.example.com/.well-known/host-meta" and
        performs a GET request on it.</t>

        <section anchor="am-endpoints" title="AM Endpoints">
          <t>The AM MUST provide an XRD 1.0 formatted document at the hostmeta
          location, documenting the following: <list style="symbols">
              <t>A set of protection API endpoints for the host to use</t>

              <t>A set of authorization API endpoints for requesters to

          intended to be compatible with the ultimate dynamic discovery,
          registration, and binding solution proposed by the OAuth group. The

      <section title="Host Registers with AM">
        <t>If the host has not already obtained a client identifier and
        optional secret from this AM previously, in this step it MUST do so in
        order to engage in OAuth-based interactions with the AM. This MAY be
        done using the UMA dynamic registration protocol (see <xref
        target="Dyn-Reg">Dyn-Reg</xref>).</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Host Obtains Host Access Token">
        <t>In this step, the host acquires a host access token from the AM
        that represents the approval of the authorizing user for the host to
        trust the AM for protecting resources belonging to the user.</t>

        <t>The host MUST use the <xref target="OAuth2">OAuth2</xref>
        authorization code grant type or the SAML bearer token grant type
        <xref target="OAuth-SAML"></xref>, utilizing the end-user
        authorization and token endpoints as appropriate. Here the host acts
        in the role of an OAuth client. The authorizing user acts in the role
        of an OAuth end-user resource owner. The AM, through the provided
        endpoint URLs, acts in the role of an OAuth authorization server.</t>

        <t>The host has completed this step successfully when it possesses a
        host access token it can use at the AM's protection API.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Host Registers Sets of Resources to Be Protected">
        <t>Once the host has received a host access token, for any of the
        user's sets of resources that are to be protected by this AM, it MUST
        register these resource sets at the AM's registration endpoint.</t>

        <t>Note that the host is free to offer the option to protect any
        subset of the user's resources using different AMs or other means
        entirely, or to protect some resources and not others. Additionally,
        the choice of protection regimes can be made explicitly by the user or
        implicitly by the host. Any such partitioning by the host or user is
        outside the scope of this specification.</t>

        <section anchor="resource-reg-example"
                 title="Example of Registering Resource Sets">
          <t>The following example illustrates the intent and usage of
          resource set registration.</t>

          <t>This example contains some steps that are exclusively in the
          realm of user experience rather than web protocol, to achieve
          realistic illustration; these steps are labeled "User experience
          only". Some other steps are exclusively internal to the operation of
          the entity being discussed; these are labeled "Internal only".</t>

          <t>An authorizing user, Alice Adams, has just uploaded a photo of
          her new puppy to a host, Photoz.example.com, and wants to ensure
          that this specific photo is not publicly accessible.</t>

          <t>Alice has already introduced this host to her AM,
          CopMonkey.example.com, and thus Photoz has already obtained a host
          access token from CopMonkey. However, Alice has not previously
          instructed Photoz to use CopMonkey to protect any other photos of
          hers.</t>

          <t>Alice has previously visited CopMonkey to map a default "do not
          share with anyone" policy to any resource sets registered by Photoz,
          until such time as she maps some other less-draconian policies to
          those resources. (User experience only. This may have been done at
          the time Alice introduced the host to the AM, and/or it could have
          been a global or host-specific preference setting. A different
          constraint or no constraint at all might be associated with newly
          protected resources.) Other kinds of policies she may eventually map
          to particular photos or albums might be "Share only with
          husband@email.example.net" or "Share only with people in my 'family'
          group".</t>

          <t>Photoz itself has a publicly documented API that offers two dozen
          different methods that apply to single photos, such as "addTags" and
          "getSizes", but rolls them up into two photo-related scopes of
          access: "viewing" (consisting of varous read-only operations) and
          "all" (consisting of various reading, editing, and printing
          operations). It defines two Web-accessible JSON-encoded documents
          called scope descriptions that represent these scopes, which it is
          able to reuse for all of its users (not just Alice). The "name"
          parameter values are intended to be seen by Alice when she maps
          authorization constraints to specific resource sets and actions
          while visiting CopMonkey, such that Alice would see the strings
          "View Photo and Related Info" and "All Actions", likely accompanied
          by the referenced icons, in the CopMonkey interface. (Other users of
          Photoz might similarly see the same labels at CopMonkey or whatever
          other AM they use.)</t>

        }
}]]></artwork>
          </figure>

          <t>While visiting Photoz, Alice selects a link or button that
          instructs the site to "Protect" or "Share" this single photo (user
          experience only; Photoz could have made this a default or preference
          setting).</t>

          <t>As a result, Photoz defines for itself a resource set that
          represents this photo (internal only; Photoz is the only application
          that knows how to map a particular photo to a particular resource
          set). Photoz also prepares the following resource set description,
          which is specific to Alice and her photo. The "name" parameter value
          is intended to be seen by Alice in mapping authorization constraints
          to specific resource sets and actions when she visits CopMonkey,
          such that Alice would see the string "Steve the puppy!", likely
          accompanied by the referenced icon, in the CopMonkey interface. The
          possible scopes of access on this resource set are indicated with
          URI references to the action descriptions, as defined just
          above.</t>

          <figure>
            <artwork><![CDATA[{
        "resource_set":

        }
}]]></artwork>
          </figure>

          <t>Photoz uses the "create resource set description" method of
          CopMonkey's standard UMA-based resource registration API, presenting
          its Alice-specific host access token there, to register and assign
          an identifier to the resource set description. The resource set
          identifier path component of the URL matches the "_id" parameter
          value in the description.</t>

          <figure>
            <artwork><![CDATA[PUT /host/photoz.example.com/resource/112210f47de98100

         }
}]]></artwork>
          </figure>

          <t>Once this description has been successfully registered, Photoz is
          responsible for responding to requesters' attempts to access this
          photo, achieving protection of the resource by "outsourcing" this
          task to CopMonkey.</t>

          <t>At the time Alice indicates she would like this photo protected,
          Photoz can choose to redirect Alice to CopMonkey for further policy
          setting, access auditing, and other AM-related tasks (user
          experience only).</t>

          <t>Over time, as Alice uploads other photos and creates and
          organizes photo albums, and as Photoz makes new action functionality
          available, Photoz can use additional methods of the resource
          registration API to ensure that CopMonkey's understanding of Alice's
          protected resources matches its own.</t>

    <section anchor="getting-authz-accessing-resource"
             title="Getting Authorization and Accessing a Resource">
      <t>Phase 2 of UMA is getting authorization, and Phase 3 is accessing a
      resource. In these phases, an AM orchestrates and controls requesting
      parties' access to a user's protected resources at a host, under
      conditions dictated by that user.</t>

      <t>A series of pairwise interactions characterize this entire
      authorization and access process. Phase 2 always begins with the
      requester attempting access at a protected resource endpoint at the
      host. How the requester came to learn about this endpoint is out of
      scope for UMA; the authorizing user might, for example, have advertised
      its availability publicly on a blog or other website, listed it in a
      discovery service, or emailed a link to a particular intended requesting
      party.</t>

      <t>The host responds to the requester's access request in one of several
      ways depending on the circumstances of the request, either immediately
      or having first performed one or more embedded interactions with the AM.
      Depending on the nature of the host's response to an failed access
      attempt, the requester itself engages in embedded interactions with the
      AM before re-attempting access.</t>

      <t>Phase 3 is merely the successful completion of a requester's access
      attempt (see <xref target="sufficient-scope"></xref>) that initially
      involved several embedded interactions among the requester, AM, and host
      in Phase 2.</t>

      <t>The interactions can be summarized as follows. The interaction
      summarized in each top-level list item MAY stop at the end of that time,
      if the requester chooses not to continue pursuing access to the
      resource.<list style="symbols">
          <t>The requester attempts access at a particular protected resource
          at a host (see <xref target="r-h-attempt-access"></xref>).<list
              style="symbols">
              <t>If the user corresponding to the protected resource URI is
              ambiguous: host responds immediately with an error (see <xref
              target="ambiguous-user"></xref>).</t>

              <t>If the user is unambiguous but the access attempt is
              unaccompanied by a requester access token: host responds
              immediately with instructions on where to go to obtain one (see
              <xref target="no-token"></xref>).</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>If the access attempt was accompanied by a requester access
          token, the host validates the token at the AM (see <xref
          target="h-am-token-validation"></xref>).<list style="symbols">
              <t>If the AM reports that the requester access token is invalid
              (see <xref target="token-invalid"></xref>), the host responds
              with instructions on where to go to obtain a token (see <xref
              target="no-token"></xref>).</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>If the AM reports that the requester access token is valid (see
          <xref target="token-valid"></xref>) but none of the permissions
          associated with the token match the scope of attempted access, the
          host registers a suitable permission on the requester's behalf at
          the AM (see <xref target="h-am-register-scope"></xref>) and then
          responds to the requester with instructions on where to go to
          request authorization to associate that permission with its token
          (see <xref target="insufficient-scope"></xref>).</t>

          <t>If the requester received instructions on where to go to get a
          token, it requests a token from the appropriate AM (see <xref
          target="r-am-obtain-token"></xref>).</t>

          <t>If the requester received instructions on where to go to get
          authorization for access permission, it requests permission from the
          appropriate AM (see <xref target="r-am-authz-scope"></xref>).</t>

          <t>If the AM reported that the requester access token is valid, and
          at least one of the permissions associated with the token match the
          scope of attempted access, the host responds to the requester's
          access attempt with success (see <xref
          target="sufficient-scope"></xref>).</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This process extends OAuth in several notable ways:<list
          style="symbols">
          <t>The requester access token signifies only a binding of this
          requester, the requesting party on whose behalf it is acting, this
          host, this authorizing user, and this AM, to be reused for all
          permissions to access any of the user's protected resources at this
          host that are protected by this AM.</t>

          <t>Any real-time authorizing user (resource owner) consent required
          by policy is gathered at the time of claim requests, rather than at
          the time of token issuance; the flow does not distinguish between
          policies for "person-to-person" sharing and policies for
          "person-to-self" sharing.</t>

          <t>The process of seeking authorization does not just rely on the
          requester's ability to authenticate as the (or a) resource owner,
          but admits a wide-ranging set of policy options based on attributes
          of the requesting party. This model could be called claims-based
          authorization.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The interactions are described in detail in the following
      sections.</t>

      <section anchor="r-h-attempt-access"
               title="Requester-Host: Attempt Access at Protected Resource">
        <t>This interaction assumes that the host has previously registered
        with an AM one or more resource sets that correspond to the resource
        to which access is being attempted, such that the host considers this
        resource to be protected by a particular AM.</t>

        <t>The requester is typically attempts to access the desired resource
        at the host directly (for example, when a human operator of the
        requester software clicks on a thumbnail representation of the
        resource). The requester is expected to discover, or be provisioned
        with, knowledge of the protected resource and its location out of
        band. Further, the requester is expected to acquire its own knowledge
        about the methods made available by the host for operating on this
        resource (such as viewing it with a GET method, or transforming it
        with some complex API call) and the possible scopes of access.</t>

        <t>The host responds in one of five ways.</t>

        <section anchor="ambiguous-user"
                 title="Requester's Request Is Ambiguous">
          <t>By the nature of the requester's request for access (for example,
          through a URI parameter specifying a username or other identifier),
          the host needs to be able to detect uniquely which one of its users
          has the operative control over access to this resource. Without
          this, the host will be unable to interact with the correct AM using
          the correct host access token in protecting the resource.</t>

          <t>If the requester's request is ambiguous with respect to the
          specific user at the host, the host rimmediately esponds with an
          "ambiguous-user error" message.</t>

          the operative control over access to the resource (see <xref
          target="ambiguous-user"></xref>), but the requester does not present
          any access token with the request, the host MUST return an HTTP 400
          status code indicating it is an "invalid_request" [REF: Section
          2.4.1 of OAuth Bearer Token draft]. This indicates to the requester
          one of the following: that the request is missing a required
          parameter, that it includes an unsupported parameter or parameter
          value, that it repeats the same parameter, that it uses more than
          one method for including an access token, or that it is otherwise
          malformed.</t>

        credentials authorization grant type (see Section 4.4 of <xref
        target="OAuth2"></xref>).</t>

        <t>In UMA, unlike in plain OAuth, obtaining an access token does not
        automatically convey permission for access to any protected resource.
        The token must first be associated with at least one suitable
        permission for scoped access in order for the requester to succeed in
        accessing the resource.</t>

        <t>In the case where the requester does not yet have a unique
        credential and where the AM demands such a unique credential, the
        requester MAY use the dynamic registration protocol (see <xref
        target="Dyn-Reg"></xref>), if the AM supports or requires it. The
        dynamic registration protocol allows the AM to provide the requester
        with a unique client identifier and optionally a client secret in a
        dynamic fashion.</t>

      <section anchor="h-am-token-validation"
               title="Host-AM: Validate Requester's Presented Access Token">
        <t>On receiving a requester access token in an access attempt, the
        host asks the AM to validate this token. It gains authorized access to
        the AM's token validation endpoint by presenting its own host access
        token in the request to validate the requester's access token. The
        host access token also allows the host and AM to uniquely identify the
        user they have in common, and therefore allows the AM to look up the
        correct user policies and settings.</t>

        <t>The host's request to the AM is made with a POST containing the
        requester access token and the IP address of the requester's request.
        The host MAY, at its discretion, instead supply the originating IP
        address indicated in the requester's X-Forwarded-For: header value.
        The POST uses the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format as
        defined by [W3C.REC-html401-19991224]. The IP address or originating
        IP address is advisory only; the AM MAY ignore it for token validation
        purposes. The host supplies its host access token with the
        request.</t>

        <t>(ISSUE #35: Consider allowing the host to provide a filter in the
        token validation request to indicate the particular resource
        sets/scopes it would find acceptable, so that the AM can provide only
        permissions that potentially match any of them. This approaches a
        PDP/PEP model.)</t>

               title="Requester-AM: Request Authorization for Scoped Permission">
        <t>In this interaction, the requester asks the AM to grant
        authorization to add a permission to its access token for use at a
        particular host. It does this at the AM's authorization endpoint by
        supplying the permission ticket it got from the host, along with its
        requester access token. The AM uses this information to look up the
        previously registered permission, confirm that the correct requester
        is asking for it, map the requested permission to operative user
        policies, and demand in turn that the requester convey any claims
        needed to support its request.</t>

        <t>The requester performs a GET on the authorization endpoint, using
        the standard HTTP "Accept" header to express the acceptable media
        type(s) of any claims-requested response. (ISSUE#14: Need to unify the
        request for authorization with the providing of claims, so that this
        can be a single request-response pattern that can loop as required.
        Should it always be a POST therefore?)</t>

        <t>The AM responds in one of three ways: <list style="symbols">
            <t>If the AM requires no claims (or no further claims) from the
            requester in order to grant authorization for the asked-for
            permission based on user policy, it gives a success response,
            indicating that the requested scope has been associated with the
            requester's token.</t>

            <t>If the requester is definitively not authorized for this
            permission according to user policy, the AM responds with a
            failure response and the authorization request phase ends.</t>

            <t>If user policy demands more information from the requester, the
            AM responds with a claims-requested response. The list SHOULD use
            the claim format media type that was indicated by the requester as
            acceptable.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The claims-requested list MAY contain internal logic that gives a
        choice or other variability around the sets of claims that will
        satisfy the request. This potentially allows the requester to select a
        subset of claims to supply in order to obtain the needed
        permission.</t>

        <t>The requester re-POSTs the authorization request, providing any
        claims it has chosen to supply to satisfy the request for claims. f
        the AM accepts the claims document submitted by the requester, the AM
        responds with a successful or unsuccessful access token response, or
        with another claims-required response. This loop can be run through as
        many times as necessary for the AM to request further claims and the
        requester to supply them, re-asking for authorization to get the
        needed permission at every juncture.</t>

        <t>If the content-type is not recognized by the AM, the AM will reject
        the document. (ISSUE#15: If the content-type (of the claims response
        document) is not recognized by the AM, what happens then? Should be an
        error from the AM.)</t>

        <t>(ISSUE#16: Eventually need some special claim types that allow for
        the trusted-claims model to unfold.)</t>

        <t>This specification does not define the formats of required-claims
        lists and claims documents. It may ultimately put minimum conformance
        requirements on requesters and AMs to handle particular claim formats
        defined in other specifications, as well as specifying requirements
        that claim formats seeking consideration for use in UMA must meet. One
        candidate specification for lightweight claims requests and responses
        is <xref target="Claims2.0">Claims2.0</xref>.</t>

          <t>(ISSUE#16: Eventually need some special claim types that allow
          for the trusted-claims model to unfold.)</t>

          <t>This specification will refer to OpenID Connect emerging protocol
          as mechanism to support claims-based access control to enable
          specific UMA use cases in which the access control decision to grant
          access to Authorizing User's resource is made based on Requesting
          Party information, such as Subject's name, age, email address, role,
          location, etc.</t>

          <t>OpenID Connect provides authentication, authorization, and
          attribute transmission capability. The integration approach uses
          OpenID Connect protocol to request Requesting Party&rsquo;s claims,
          leveraging OpenID Connect mechanisms to transmit attributes from
          distributed sources.</t>

          <t>The interoperability scenario is based on two AM's
          interfaces:</t>

          <t>- OpenID 2.0 Relying Party</t>

          <t>- Claims Client for OpenID Connect OpenID 2.0</t>

          <t>Relying Party interface is responsible to authenticate the
          Requesting Party and initialize the OpenID Connect protocol. Claims
          Client interface is responsible to request claims based on OpenID
          Connect protocol, in order to satisfy claim-based policy. The Client
          interacts with the OpenID Connect's Authorization Server to obtain
          specific access token to access to the Requesting Party&rsquo;s
          UserInfo EndPoint (trusted claims provider).</t>

      <t>Ultimately the host is responsible for either granting the access the
      requester attempted, or returning an error response to the requester
      with a reason for the failure. <xref target="OAuth2"></xref> defines
      several error responses for a resource server to return. UMA makes use
      of these error responses, but requires the host to "outsource" the
      determination of some error conditions to the AM.</t>

      <t>The host is responsible for determining "insufficient_scope". If the
      requester's attempted access does not match any of the scopes returned
      by the AM in its valid-token response to the host, the host returns an
      "insufficient_scope" error to the requester.</t>

      <t>The host is responsible for determining "invalid_request". If the
      requester's request was badly formed, the host returns an
      "invalid_request" error to the requester.</t>

      <t>If the AM determined that the requester access token is invalid, it
      returns an "invalid_requester_token" error response to the host. [@@TBS:
      Need to flesh out more and provide an example.] The host then returns an
      "invalid_token" response to the requester as described in section 5.2.1
      of <xref target="OAuth2"></xref>.</t>

      <t>If the AM determined that the requester access token has expired, it
      returns an "expired_requester_token" error response to the host. [@@TBS:
      Need to flesh out more and provide an example.] The host then returns an
      "invalid_token" response to the requester as described in section 5.2.1
      of <xref target="OAuth2"></xref>.</t>

      <t>If the host's token validation request message itself was badly

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This specification relies mainly on OAuth security mechanisms for
      protecting the host registration endpoint at the AM so that only a
      properly authorized host can access it on behalf of the intended user.
      For example, the host needs to use a valid host access token issued
      through a user authorization process at the endpoint, and the
      interaction should take place over TLS. It is expected that the host
      will protect its client secret (if it was issued one) and will protect
      its host access token, particularly if used in "bearer token"
      fashion.</t>

      <t>In addition, this specification dictates a binding between the host
      access token and the host-specific registration area on the AM to
      prevent a host from interacting with a registration area not its
      own.</t>

      <t>(ISSUE#18: All drafts are required to have a security considerations
      section. See RFC 3552. Other stuff goes here too. Provide commentary on
      any requirements layered on the forthcoming OAuth security
      considerations section; discuss UMA-layer implications for more
      meaningful authentication of requesters/requesting parties; discuss
      implications of user-mediated AM/host trust model; discuss short-lived
      token technique for lightweight requester correlation...)</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Privacy Considerations">
      <t>The AM comes to be in possession of resource set information (such as
      names and icons) that may reveal information about the user, which the
      AM's trust relationship with the host is assumed to accommodate.
      However, the requester is a less-trusted party (in fact, entirely
      untrustworthy until it acquires a requester access token in UMA protocol
      step 2). This specification recommends obscuring resource set
      identifiers in order to avoid leaking personally identifiable
      information to requesters through the "scope" mechanism.</t>

          <t>ISSUE#02: RESOLVED. (Need to clarify how the requester's user
          authorization endpoint would be used in an UMA (vs. an OAuth)
          fashion for collecting synchronous authorizing user consent in Phase
          2, based on a privileged type of claim request.) RESOLUTION: The
          need for this endpoint goes away because it's all handled by
          policies that require certain claims to be provided, one of which
          could be for the requesting party to prove it has a certain identity
          (which could happen to be an identity that the authorizing user can
          prove). EDITED IN: Rev 11.</t>

          <t>ISSUE#03: RESOLVED. (Do we need to specify explicitly a means for
          the requester to get a new or refreshed access token from the AM, or
          can we mostly just refer to OAuth for this? Right now this
          interaction type doesn't have its own section.) RESOLUTION: New
          section added. EDITED IN: Rev 09 (I think).</t>

          the token validation request message. Can Maciej supply what they're
          using?)</t>

          <t>ISSUE#05: When the token is invalid, what's the current OAuth
          thinking on what we should return? Is there any reason not to copy
          OAuth as closely as possible in this case? Or should a token status
          of "invalid" be used, and returned as success (unifying the
          different kinds of responses to the validation request)?</t>

          <t>ISSUE#12: If the the AM finds the requester's access token to be
          invalid, it returns an UMA error message (correct? HTTP success?) to
          indicate that the requester's token is invalid.</t>

          <t>ISSUE#13: How to structure the body to include the scope and also
          the requester's access token?</t>

          <t>ISSUE#14: Need to unify the request for authorization with the
          providing of claims, so that this can be a single request-response
          pattern that can loop as required.</t>

          <t>ISSUE#15: If the content-type (of the claims response document)
          is not recognized by the AM, what happens then? Should be an error
          from the AM.</t>

          <t>ISSUE#16: Eventually need some special claim types that allow for
          the trusted-claims model to unfold.</t>

          <t>ISSUE#17: Need to say what claims format is supported.
          "openid-connect" is now listed as the only option, temporarily.</t>

          <t>ISSUE#18: Provide commentary on any requirements layered on the
          forthcoming OAuth security considerations section; discuss UMA-layer
          implications for more meaningful authentication of
          requesters/requesting parties; discuss implications of user-mediated
          AM/host trust model; discuss short-lived token technique for
          lightweight requester correlation...</t>

          <t>ISSUE#19: Other stuff goes here too. More privacy
          considerations.</t>

          <t>ISSUE#20: From Lukasz email 6/6/2011: Rev8 Section 2.2: +1 for
          validation request in json format instead of
          application/x-www-form-urlencoded.</t>

          <t>ISSUE#21: From Lukasz email 6/6/2011: Rev8 Section 2.4: AM adds a
          scope to the requester's access token. Maybe I am missing something
          but I don't see the explanation in the spec how requester's token is
          issued at first. I think some parts are mutual for the host and the
          requester i.e. AM Discovery, optional Dynamic Client
          Registration.</t>

          <t>ISSUE#22: From Lukasz email 6/6/2011: Rev8 Section 3.4.2: Example
          is missing required '_id' parameter. ACTION#22: '_id' parameter
          added.</t>

          <t>ISSUE#23: From Lukasz email 6/6/2011: Rev8 Section 4: 403
          Forbidden response when: 'unsupported method or host ID not matching
          the presented host access token'. I think AM should return 403 in
          case of performing operations on resources of different user (not
          owned resources at this same host), instead of returning 404 Not
          Found to not disclose presence of the resource set at the AM.</t>

          <t>ISSUE#24: From Lukasz email 6/6/2011: Rev8 Section 4.1: Empty
          response body? In SAM we return 'resource_id' and 'policy_uri' so
          that the host can redirect the user to the policy definition page
          (sharing setting screen) on AM.</t>

          <t>ISSUE#25: From Lukasz email 6/6/2011: Section 4.1 - what happens
          when a resource (being registered) already exists?</t>

          <t>ISSUE#26: RESOLVED. From Lukasz email 6/6/2011: Section 4.1 to
          4.4: URLs in the examples mistakenly contains '/user/{userid}'.
          RESOLUTION: Examples have been corrected.</t>

          <t>ISSUE#27: Can Update Resource Set Description API mistakenly
          overwrite/destroy an existing resource description?. (<xref
          target="update-resource-set"></xref>)</t>

          <t>ISSUE #28: Okay to require the AM to support the authorization
          code grant type, in addition to optionally supporting the SAML
          bearer assertion grant type, to give a baseline of
          mandatory-to-implement functionality? Lukasz and Eve agree so
          far.</t>

          <t>ISSUE #29: Should we extend the resource set (and/or scope)
          description parameters along the lines of the SMART project? Related
          to ISSUE #24 as well.</t>

          <t>ISSUE #30: We say the {hostid} has to be the client ID, but what
          if the host is in the position of using anonymous credentials for
          some reason? Is that even a possibility in the case of hosts (vs.
          requesters)? Should we identify this more obviously as a constraint?
          Lukasz and Eve think it should be identified as a constraint,
          meaning that if dynamic registration is used, it has to support
          truly unique client credential issuance.</t>

          <t>ISSUE #31: Should the response to creating or updating a resource
          set description play back the just-registered description? See how
          SCIM works for an example of this.</t>

          <t>ISSUE #32: Need to add back detail on how the host tells the
          requester which AM to go to so that it can discover the token
          endpoint and authorization endpoint. Lukasz and Maciej will flesh
          this out with their own message examples.</t>

          <t>ISSUE #33: Should it be possible to have an "implicit resource
          set" somehow that (in syntactic-sugar fashion) allows permissions to
          be passed around much as scopes already are passed around in plain
          OAuth?</t>

          <t>ISSUE #34: Should we have only one host registration endoint, or
          do we need two: one for resource set registration and one for
          permission registration?</t>

          <t>ISSUE #35: Consider allowing the host to provide a filter in the
          token validation request to indicate the particular resource
          sets/scopes it would find acceptable, so that the AM can provide
          only permissions that potentially match any of them. This approaches
          a PDP/PEP model.</t>
